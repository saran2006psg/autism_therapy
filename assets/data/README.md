# Assets Data Directory

This directory contains static data files used in the ThrivEers app.

## Structure:

- `activities/` - Predefined activity templates and configurations
- `localization/` - Translation files (future feature)
- `sample/` - Sample data for testing and demos

## Guidelines:

- Use JSON format for structured data
- Include validation schemas where appropriate
- Keep data files small and optimized
- Document data structure in comments
- Use meaningful file names
