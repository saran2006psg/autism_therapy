# Assets Images Directory

This directory contains image assets used in the ThrivEers app.

## Structure:

- `avatars/` - User and student avatar images
- `icons/` - Custom app icons and graphics
- `backgrounds/` - Background images for various screens
- `illustrations/` - Educational and therapy-related illustrations

## Guidelines:

- Use PNG for images with transparency
- Use JPG/JPEG for photographs
- Keep file sizes optimized for mobile/web performance
- Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `student_avatar_default.png`)
- Provide multiple resolutions when needed (@2x, @3x)
