## Email-Based Student-Parent Linking System

### ✅ What I've Implemented

**Enhanced Add Student Form:**
1. **New Parent Email Field** - Optional field for linking students to parent accounts
2. **Email Validation** - Proper email format validation
3. **User Lookup Integration** - Automatically finds parent user ID by email
4. **Smart Feedback** - Shows success/warning messages based on parent account status

**Backend Integration:**
1. **getUserIdByEmail Method** - New Firestore service method to find users by email
2. **Enhanced Student Creation** - Automatically links students to parent accounts
3. **Parent ID Storage** - Stores parent user IDs in student records for access control

**Delete Functionality:**
1. **Individual Delete Buttons** - Delete icon next to each student
2. **Bulk Delete Option** - "Delete All" button in the app bar (only visible when students exist)
3. **Confirmation Dialogs** - Proper confirmation before deletion
4. **Soft Delete** - Uses Firebase soft delete (sets isActive: false)

### 🔄 How the Email-Based Linking Works

**Step 1: Therapist Creates Student**
```
1. Therapist fills out student information
2. Therapist enters parent's email in "Parent Email" field
3. System searches for existing user with that email
4. If found: Links student to parent's user ID
5. If not found: Creates student without parent link (shows warning)
```

**Step 2: Parent Registration/Login**
```
1. Parent registers with the same email used by therapist
2. System automatically links them to their children
3. Parent can immediately see their child's data
```

**Step 3: Real-Time Data Access**
```
- Therapist sees: students where therapistId = their user ID
- Parent sees: students where parentIds contains their user ID
- Real-time sync: Changes appear immediately for both parties
```

### 🔍 Database Structure

**Student Document:**
```json
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe", 
  "therapistId": "therapist_user_id",
  "parentIds": ["parent_user_id_1", "parent_user_id_2"],
  "isActive": true,
  // ... other fields
}
```

**User Document:**
```json
{
  "email": "parent@example.com",

}
```

### 🚀 Testing the System

1. **Create a student** with parent email
2. **Register as parent** with same email
3. **Login as parent** - should see the child
4. **Login as therapist** - should see all their students
5. **Test deletion** - use delete buttons to remove test data

The system now provides complete email-based linking between therapists, students, and parents with real-time synchronization!
