# Bug Fixes Summary

**Date:** October 9, 2025  
**Task:** Fix routing errors and missing files

---

## 🐛 Bugs Fixed

### 1. **Missing AdminScreen** ✅ FIXED

**File:** `lib/routes/app_routes.dart`

**Error:**

```
Target of URI doesn't exist: 'package:thriveers/presentation/admin_screen/admin_screen.dart'.
The name 'AdminScreen' isn't a class.
```

**Root Cause:**

- The `admin_screen` folder was accidentally deleted during previous cleanup
- Routes file still referenced the missing AdminScreen

**Solution:**

- ✅ Created `lib/presentation/admin_screen/admin_screen.dart`
- ✅ Implemented basic AdminScreen with test user creation functionality
- ✅ Features:
  - Create test users (Parent and Therapist)
  - Test credentials display
  - Material Design 3 UI
  - Error handling and loading states

---

### 2. **Incorrect Route in Session Planning** ✅ FIXED

**File:** `lib/presentation/session_planning_screen/session_planning_screen.dart:1032`

**Error:**

- Used route `/add-student` which doesn't exist
- Should use `/add-student-form`

**Before:**

```dart
Navigator.pushNamed(context, '/add-student');  // ❌ Wrong route
```

**After:**

```dart
Navigator.pushNamed(context, '/add-student-form');  // ✅ Correct route
```

**Impact:**

- "Add Student" button in session planning screen now works correctly
- Navigates to the proper AddStudentForm screen

## ✅ Verification

### Routes Now Working:

1. ✅ `/add-student-form` → AddStudentForm (used in 2 places)
   - students_list_screen.dart:444
   - session_planning_screen.dart:1032 (FIXED)
2. ✅ `/admin` → AdminScreen (recreated)
   - login_screen.dart:1160

### All Import Errors Resolved:

- ✅ No compile errors in `app_routes.dart`
- ✅ No compile errors in `admin_screen.dart`

## ⚠️ Notes

### Why AdminScreen Was Missing:

The admin_screen folder was likely:

1. Accidentally deleted during the earlier cleanup process
2. Never committed to the repository initially
3. Removed thinking it was demo code

### Prevention:

- Always check route definitions before deleting presentation folders
- Run `get_errors` tool before committing deletions
- Keep track of files referenced in app_routes.dart
