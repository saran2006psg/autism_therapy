# Dashboard UI Improvements & Error Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Type Error Resolution
**Issue**: `TypeError: null: type 'Null' is not a subtype of type 'String'`
- **Root Cause**: `CustomImageWidget` was receiving null values for `imageUrl` parameter but was being cast to `String` with `as String`
- **Solution**: 
  - Updated `CustomImageWidget` to handle null/empty imageUrl gracefully
  - Changed casts from `as String` to `as String?` in parent dashboard and child header widgets
  - Implemented better null checking in the image widget

### 2. CustomImageWidget Enhancements
- **Improved Error Handling**: Better fallback UI when images fail to load
- **Enhanced Placeholder**: More polished loading state with styled progress indicator
